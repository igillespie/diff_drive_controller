# diff_drive_controller
Different drive controller for ros2 robot. Subscribes to wheel encoder ticks and publishes odometry and joint state messages.

This originally camed from [automaticaddison.com].(https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-publish-wheel-encoder-tick-data-using-ros-and-arduino/) I've updated it to work with RO2-galactic.
